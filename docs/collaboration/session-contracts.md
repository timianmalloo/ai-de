# Two sessions, one repository

Two agent sessions work this repository at once, in separate worktrees:

| Session | Accountable for |
|---|---|
| **Core** (Claude Code) | The workspace, repository analysis, extractors, the graph, and the interaction *between* surfaces |
| **Design** (GitHub Copilot) | Styling and the distinct design surfaces |

**This document is a proposal until the design session amends or accepts it.** It is written down
because "we'll coordinate" is not a coordination mechanism, and because the first thing two sessions
lose is not code — it is agreement about what each of them thought was true.

---

## 1. The seam: Core produces view models, Design renders them

One sentence, and every ownership rule below follows from it.

```
  extractor  ->  store  ->  projection  ->  VIEW MODEL  ->  surface control  ->  pixels
  \___________________ Core ___________________/          \_______ Design ________/
                                          ^
                                     the contract
```

A view model is a **record with no behaviour and no WPF types**. It carries what the user needs to
know, including what could *not* be established — a projection that hides a gap forces the surface to
invent one. Core owes Design a view model that is complete and honest; Design owes Core a rendering
that shows all of it, including the parts that are inconvenient to lay out.

**Neither side reaches across.** Core does not decide colour, spacing or control choice. Design does
not compute a number, filter a collection, or re-derive a label from raw evidence — if a surface
needs a value the view model does not carry, that is a Core change, requested rather than worked
around. A number computed in a surface is a second definition of a quantity that already has one,
which is the defect signature the data-modelling standard names.

## 2. File ownership

Ownership means: **you edit it, the other session proposes changes to it.** It does not mean the
other session may not read it — reading is how contracts stay honest.

### Core owns

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `src/AiDe.Core/**` | Extraction, store, projections, layout model, terminal runtime |
| `src/AiDe.Daemon/**` | The process boundary and what it composes |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/WorkbenchShell.cs` | Binds surfaces to evidence — "interaction between surfaces" |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/WorkbenchController.cs`, `WorkbenchAdapter.cs` | Command routing and layout application |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/SurfaceContentFactory.cs` | The registry mapping a surface kind to a control |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/LayoutPersistence.cs` | Layout state, versioning and restore |
| `src/AiDe.App/ViewModels/**` | Composition root wiring |
| `tests/AiDe.Core.Tests/**`, `spikes/**`, `tools/**` | Evidence and gates |

### Design owns

| Path | Why |
|---|---|
| `src/AiDe.App/App.xaml`, `MainWindow.xaml` (+ `.cs`) | Theme, tokens, window chrome |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/ContextMapSurface.cs` | A design surface |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/JoinSurface.cs` | A design surface |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/CanvasPage.cs`, `CanvasSurface.cs` | The graph surface and its embedded page |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/TerminalView.cs`, `TerminalPalette.cs` | Terminal rendering and colour |
| `src/AiDe.App/Workbench/CommandPalette.cs`, `PromptBar.cs`, `MainMenuBuilder.cs` | Interactive chrome |
| `docs/mockups/**`, `docs/design/**` | Design artifacts |

### Shared, and therefore rule-bound

| Path | Rule |
|---|---|
| `src/AiDe.Core/Projections/*.cs` (the view-model records) | **Core edits; Design requests.** Adding a field is a Core change with a Core test |
| `src/AiDe.Core/Workbench/LayoutModel.cs` | Core edits. Adding a surface KIND is a joint change — see §4 |
| `tests/AiDe.App.Tests/**` | Whoever owns the file under test owns its test |
| `docs/lessons/defect-classes.md` | **Append only.** Both sessions add classes; nobody rewrites another's entry |
| `docs/audit/*.jsonl` | Append only, through `audit-log.py`. Never hand-edited — ids collide (DC-013) |
| `docs/docs-index.js` | **Derived. Never hand-edited.** Regenerate with `docs-graph.py derive`; a conflict here is resolved by regenerating, never by merging |

---

## 3. The contracts themselves

These are the types the seam is made of. **Core may add to them; Core may not remove from or
reinterpret them without agreement.**

| Contract | Shape | Who consumes it |
|---|---|---|
| `Surface(SurfaceId, Kind, Title)` | The identity of a pane, independent of where it is docked | Both |
| `SurfaceContentFactory.KnownKinds` | The set of kinds that can be built | Both — and the layout restore, which drops what is not in it |
| `ContextMapView` | Contexts, crossings, uncovered groups, `IsDeclared` | Design renders |
| `JoinResult` / `JoinEdge` | Joins with `Status` and `Basis` | Design renders |
| `CanvasGraph` / `CanvasNode` / `CanvasEdge` | The graph as the canvas draws it | Design renders |
| `IWorkspaceQueries` | The read surface, in-process or across the daemon | Core only |
| `ILayoutService` / `LayoutOperation` | Every arrangement change | Core applies; Design raises |
| `IWorkbenchAnnouncer` | How a change reaches assistive technology | Both |

**Two invariants neither session may break alone:**

1. **Every `LayoutOperation` has a keyboard equivalent** (SC 2.5.7) and produces an announcement
   (SC 4.1.3). A conformance test walks the operation union by reflection and fails otherwise — it
   has already caught a new operation twice.
2. **No evidence pane renders nothing**, in any state. `PaneRenderTests` asserts it for every pane
   in six states. A surface with no readable text is either broken or telling the user nothing.

---

## 4. Changing the seam

A change to anything in §3 follows the same three steps, whichever session starts it:

1. **Write it down first** — amend this document in the same commit as the change. A contract agreed
   in conversation is a contract the next session cannot read.
2. **Make it additive where possible.** A new optional field on a view model breaks nobody; a
   renamed or removed one breaks the other session's working tree without warning. `IsDeclared` was
   added with a default for exactly this reason.
3. **Land it on `main` before depending on it.** Two branches that each assume the other's unmerged
   change is how a merge becomes a rewrite.

**Adding a surface kind** is the one genuinely joint change: Core adds the kind to `KnownKinds`, the
layout model and the migration chain; Design adds the control. Do it in that order, and land the Core
half first — a kind in a saved layout with no control behind it renders an honest "unavailable" pane,
whereas a control for a kind nothing produces is dead code nobody notices.

---

## 5. Reducing merge pain, concretely

- **Rebase on `origin/main` before starting a stretch of work**, not only before pushing.
- **Push a branch per session and land small.** A day-long branch touching twenty files is not
  isolation; it is a merge deferred.
- **Never hand-merge a derived file.** `docs/docs-index.js` and `docs/audit/audit-data.js` are
  regenerated: take either side and re-run the generator.
- **Register the session** — `coord session start` — so the worktree tooling can see you. A cleanup
  run judged an unregistered tree "unheld" and removed it while a session was in it (DC-024). The
  filesystem-recency rule added afterwards is a floor, not a substitute.
- **Announce a file you are about to restructure**, before you start. Ownership stops most
  collisions; it does not stop two sessions both deciding a file needs splitting.

---

## 6. What this document does not settle

- Whether `main` keeps taking fast-forwards from session branches, or moves to pull requests.
- Whether the design session wants the view-model records to carry presentation hints (a severity, an
  ordering weight) or to compute those itself from the data.
- Where visual regression evidence lives, and whether it belongs in the same gate run as the unit
  tests or in a slower ring (`ci-and-test-efficiency.md` would say the slower ring).

These are open because they are joint decisions, and writing one side's preference down as settled is
how a proposal quietly becomes a fait accompli.

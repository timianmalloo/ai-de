Load-bearing findings: (1) Kuzu archived 2025-10-10, and no embedded+maintained+permissive+.NET Cypher store exists to replace it, so the IGraphStore seam is now essential; (2) MCP spec 2026-07-28 is stateless and deprecates Sampling/Roots/Logging, while the C# SDK is Microsoft+Anthropic maintained and stable; (3) Claude Code hooks have no Copilot equivalent, so a file event bus is the universal floor; (4) TTL+heartbeat leases are advisory without fencing tokens (Kleppmann, unrefuted); (5) DI, ASP.NET routes and EF mapping are structurally invisible to static analysis; (6) bounded contexts are not extractable; (7) inventory is not architecture - curation is the product.",
      "rationale": "The seed architecture sketch selected Kuzu as the graph store and assumed an MCP surface that has since changed shape; the coordination spec relies on leases whose correctness properties the distributed-systems literature explicitly denies. Establishing this evidence before design means those three decisions are remade deliberately rather than discovered during implementation. The disconfirming research also reframes the project thesis into the form (code-derived views, code authoritative) that escapes four of the five historical failure modes of model-driven engineering.",

summary: >-
  The project's register of defect classes — the recurring shapes of things that go wrong here, what
  each one survives, and the control that now fails when the shape recurs. Seeded from the ten-persona
  architecture review and the Phase-1 build.

# Defect-class register

*Governed by `continuous-improvement.md` (CI1–CI12). **One entry per class, not per bug.** A new
occurrence of an existing class appends to that class's Instances and triggers a control review — it
does not create a new entry. Read this at grounding (CI5) for the area you are working in.*

**How to use this file**
1. On any defect, correction, or falsified assumption, answer **class → sweep → derive → prevent** in writing (CI2).
2. Find the matching class below, or add one. Append the instance.
3. Climb the control ladder (CI6) and record the highest rung that actually holds: *make it impossible* > *automated control* > *always-loaded instruction* > *knowledge doc* > *register entry only*.
4. A control is not a control until it has been **observed failing** on the un-fixed code.
5. If the class would help any project — not just this one — raise it upstream via `/extendaibundle` (CI8).

**Status counts:** controlled 9 · partially-controlled 5 · uncontrolled 0
*(Not typed by hand — `python tools/verify-defect-register.py` fails when this line disagrees with the entries, and `--fix-counts` rewrites it.)*

**Recurrences since last review:** 3.
- **DC-008**, whose first control was scoped to one test project when the cause was not project-specific.
- **DC-001**, whose first control checked links between files and so could not see three classes cited by ID with no entry in this register.
- **DC-013**, which recurred the same day it was first caused, because the first occurrence was repaired without being registered at all.

*All three are CI4: a second occurrence means the control was wrong, not that someone was careless. In the first two the control had been written to fit the instances rather than the class; in the third there was no control at all, because the first occurrence was repaired and never registered — which is the failure this file exists to prevent.*

## Project classes

### DC-001 — A cited artifact is authored in a session and never actually committed
- **Signature:** something is referenced as authoritative — by a typed link, a change-log row, or an
  **identifier cited in prose** — and the thing it names is not in the repository. Often an ignore
  rule written for build output swallowing a docs path (`[Rr]elease/` ate `docs/release/`); sometimes
  a file that exists but an **entry inside it that was never written**.
- **Why it survives:** the authoring session sees the artifact and its own index entry, so every
  in-session check passes. Only a fresh clone — or a reviewer following the citation — discovers the
  hole. The identifier variant is quieter still: a reader who trusts the citation never follows it,
  and a citation carries the *appearance* of grounding whether or not it resolves.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-25 — `docs/release/ai-native-ide-release-plan.md` (Release Engineer, soft
  veto); the same rule would have hidden any future `docs/release/*`. 2026-08-25 — `spikes/` was
  ignored by the pack default, so three "Verified" contracts cited evidence that was not in the repo
  (Test Architect, hard veto). 2026-08-26 (**recurrence**) — DC-009, DC-010 and DC-011 were assigned,
  reasoned about, and cited as authoritative by four committed artifacts, with **no entry in this
  register**; `architecture.md` cited DC-010 as a controlled class that resolved to nothing, and this
  file's own header claimed twelve classes over nine. Found while assembling a status table, not by
  any gate.
- **Control:** `docs-graph.py validate` reports dangling links and index drift and is run at every
  skill close; `.gitignore` re-includes `docs/release/**` and no longer ignores `spikes/`, each with
  a comment naming this class. Observed failing 2026-08-25 (validate surfaced the dangling
  `release-plan-ai-native-ide` edge before the file was recovered).
  **Widened 2026-08-26 after the recurrence:** `tools/verify-defect-register.py`, run in CI, requires
  that every `DC-NNN` cited anywhere under `docs/` resolves to a real entry, that the ID sequence has
  no gaps, that every entry declares a known status, and that the header counts match the entries
  present. Observed failing on the un-fixed register: six findings, exit 1 — including that the
  header's `controlled` count was overstated by exactly the three missing entries.
- **Why the first control was too narrow (CI4):** `docs-graph.py validate` checks *typed links between
  files*. Both the original instances were missing files, so a file-granular control looked sufficient.
  The recurrence was a missing **entry within a committed file**, which no link traverses — the class
  was never really "a file is missing", it was "a citation resolves to nothing", and the control was
  written to the instances rather than to the class.
- **Status:** `controlled`

### DC-002 — A "Verified" label rests on evidence nobody can re-run
- **Signature:** a contract table cites a spike, a benchmark, or a run that exists only in a prior
  session's scrollback. The reader cannot inspect it, re-run it, or see what cases it covered.
- **Why it survives:** the claim is *true* — the spike really did run — so the author has no sense of
  overstating. Nothing in the loop distinguishes "was observed once" from "can be observed".
- **Instances:** 2026-08-25 — `spikes/sqlite-fact-store`, `spikes/mcp-server`,
  `spikes/conpty-foundation` cited as Verified with no committed artifact.
- **Control:** `spikes/README.md` states the policy (a Verified row must cite a committed spike with
  a captured `RESULT.md` and a one-command re-run line), and all three spikes are now committed and
  green. **Rung honestly reached: knowledge doc + convention** — there is no automated check that a
  Verified row resolves to a committed spike path. Adding one to `docs-graph.py` would raise it.
- **Status:** `partially-controlled`

### DC-003 — A durable-store invariant is enforced by a mechanism that does not cover every write path
- **Signature:** an append-only or uniqueness invariant is enforced by one mechanism (a trigger, a
  constraint, a code path) while another route reaches the same rows. The invariant reads as absolute
  in prose and is conditional in fact.
- **Why it survives:** the obvious attacks pass. A test that attempts `UPDATE` and `DELETE` goes green
  while `INSERT OR REPLACE` — which resolves its conflict with an internal delete that does *not* fire
  the `BEFORE DELETE` trigger under SQLite's default `recursive_triggers=0` — silently overwrites the
  row.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-25 — found by executing a probe against sqlite3 during the architecture
  review, not by reading the schema (Data & Persistence).
- **Control:** `StoreImmutabilityTests.InsertOrReplace_OnFactTable_CannotBypassTheDeleteTrigger`,
  plus `PRAGMA recursive_triggers=ON` on every writer connection, `query_only=1` on readers, and a
  writer API that exposes no REPLACE/UPSERT path. **Observed failing 2026-08-26** with the pragma
  removed.
- **Status:** `controlled`

### DC-004 — A side effect is recorded after it happens, so a crash makes it look like it never did
- **Signature:** an irreversible external action (a terminal write, an email, a payment) is performed
  and *then* its receipt is persisted. The window between them has no durable trace, so recovery
  cannot distinguish "never attempted" from "attempted, outcome unknown".
- **Why it survives:** the happy path and every ordinary failure path are correct. Only process death
  inside a narrow window exposes it, and the resulting duplicate looks like a client bug.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-25 — prompt dispatch recorded its receipt after the PTY write; a
  protocol-conformant retry would re-deliver a consequential prompt (Distributed Systems, hard veto).
- **Control:** ADR-0010's write-ahead two-phase receipt; `DispatchTests.Dispatch_CrashAfterWrite…`,
  `…CrashAfterAttemptBeforeWrite…` and `Retry_AfterUnknownDelivery_ReturnsTheReceiptAndNeverResends`.
  **Observed failing 2026-08-26** against the record-after-write shape (all three red).
- **Status:** `controlled`

### DC-005 — An egress control is bound to the transport instead of the destination
- **Signature:** the control answers "who connected" (a loopback bind, an allowlisted origin, a local
  socket) and is treated as if it answered "where do these bytes go next". A local process that
  forwards onward passes it untouched.
- **Why it survives:** it looks like a security control and satisfies the network-level threat model.
  The data-flow diagram stops at the local process boundary, so the onward hop is never drawn.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-25 — MCP read tools would have served workspace facts to an
  externally-processing agent that forwards them to its provider; the LINDDUN table had no MCP flow at
  all (Privacy, hard veto).
- **Control:** ADR-0011 binds tool authorization to the session's declared processing class;
  `McpRead_FromNonLocalSession_LeaksNoWorkspaceContent` (External + Unknown) and
  `McpWrite_FromNonLocalSession_IsDeniedOutright`. **Observed failing 2026-08-26** with transport-only
  authorization.
- **Status:** `controlled`

### DC-006 — A gate reports success over a corpus it never read
- **Signature:** a linter, scanner, or gate exits 0 with "no findings" because its file matcher found
  nothing it understands — not because the code is clean. The report is shaped exactly like a pass.
- **Why it survives:** exit code 0, a reassuring message, and a green CI step. Nothing asserts that
  the scan covered a non-empty corpus.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — `ui-craft-gate.py` (wrapping Impeccable, a web-source detector) returned
  `[]` against the WPF `src/AiDe.App`; a deliberately seeded `#FF00FF` in `MainWindow.xaml` produced
  no finding.
- **Control:** `TokenDisciplineTests.ComponentMarkup_UsesTokensNotRawColourValues` (**observed failing
  2026-08-26** on the seeded hex) plus `TheScan_CoversANonEmptyCorpus`, which asserts the corpus is
  non-empty — the check the gate itself lacked. Covers raw-colour discipline only; the remaining craft
  rules on this surface stay review-enforced (recorded as residual risk in the Phase-1 Proof Pack).
- **Status:** `partially-controlled`

### DC-007 — A staleness signal is measured against the system's own last observation
- **Signature:** freshness/lag is computed from the last event the system itself processed. If the
  event source dies, the metric reads perfectly healthy while the data rots.
- **Why it survives:** it is correct whenever the pipeline works, which is almost always. The failure
  mode makes the metric *better*-looking, so no alert fires.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-25 — projection stale-age measured against the daemon's last known revision,
  so a dead file watcher would read as fresh indefinitely (SRE).
- **Control:** `FreshnessProber` compares the repository-observed revision to the indexed revision;
  `FreshnessProber_DetectsDriftAgainstTheRepositoryNotTheDaemon`. Observed failing by construction
  (the prober is the only path that reads the repository independently).
- **Status:** `controlled`

### DC-008 — Test-observable global state leaks between parallel test classes
- **Signature:** assertions that pass in isolation and fail — or **vanish** — in a full run. Caused by
  process-global state (`ActivityListener`, WPF `Dispatcher`s and windows, static caches) shared
  across concurrently executing classes.
- **Why it survives:** each test is individually correct, and the failure looks like a flake. The
  WPF variant is worse: the host process **crashes mid-run**, so the runner reports the passes it had
  already recorded and simply stops. `Passed! 27` with 21 tests never executed is indistinguishable
  from a clean run unless you know the expected count.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — `TelemetryTests` captured spans emitted by `WalkingSkeletonTests`
  running concurrently. 2026-08-26 (**recurrence**) — `AiDe.App.Tests` crashed the test host once
  several classes each showed real WPF windows on STA threads at the same time; 27 of 54 tests ran.
  Found only because the count dropped from a number that had been seen before.
- **Control:** `[assembly: CollectionBehavior(DisableTestParallelization = true)]` in **both** test
  projects, each carrying the reason inline. **The first control was too narrow** — it was applied to
  `AiDe.Core.Tests` alone when the cause was not project-specific, which is precisely why this
  recurred (CI4).
- **Residual risk:** still a mitigation rather than a detection. Nothing fails if a future test
  project reintroduces shared global state under parallelism. **The detection that would close this
  is an expected-test-count assertion in CI** — a run that executes fewer tests than last time should
  fail, because a crashed host currently reports success.
- **Status:** `controlled` (mitigated in both projects; the count-regression detection is the named
  gap)

### DC-009 — A measurement is believed because its value looks reasonable
- **Signature:** a probe, benchmark or check returns a number that is plausible for the thing being
  measured, so nothing prompts a second look — and it is measuring something else. The instrument is
  pointed at the wrong moment, the wrong object, or a **proxy** for the invariant rather than the
  invariant.
- **Why it survives:** the ordinary defence against a bad measurement is that the answer looks wrong.
  Here it does not. Every instance below produced a figure a reviewer would have accepted, and each
  was caught only by asking *"could this be looking at the wrong thing?"* — never by the number
  itself being implausible. Worse, a wrong measurement **launders** into a Verified claim, so it
  corrupts the evidence trail rather than merely being absent from it (NG7).
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — the DPI probe read the thread's awareness context **before WPF had
  initialised**, reporting `UNAWARE`; re-measured after `Window.Show()` it read `SYSTEM_AWARE` (the
  wrong *moment*). 2026-08-26 — the UIA probe reported "splitter not present" from a `ClassName`
  lookup miss; enumerating every `Thumb` found it (the wrong *object*). 2026-08-26 — the
  ganged-resize test **summed pane widths** and reported "1319px inside an 885px container", which
  double-counts vertically stacked panes; there was no overlap (a *proxy* for the invariant).
  2026-08-26 — the first P1-PERF benchmark shared one store across 30 samples, so it measured
  append-only growth rather than refresh. 2026-08-26 — a gate's exit code was read through a shell
  pipe (`python … | tail; echo $?`), which reports `tail`'s status; a working gate was nearly filed
  as broken.
- **Control:** ladder rung *always-loaded instruction* — `instrumentation-over-inference.md` IO1–IO12
  and `end-to-end-integrity.md` E13–E14 (an exit code is not a result; read the state back). Two
  mechanical controls exist where the class touched code:
  `NoTwoPanesOverlap_AndNonePaneCollapsesToNothing` asserts the geometric invariant (pairwise
  intersection) rather than the width-sum proxy, and the P1-PERF harness builds an independent store
  per sample with growth measured separately. Both were observed failing on the un-fixed code.
- **Residual risk:** this is the weakest-controlled class in the register, and honestly so. No gate
  can ask "is this instrument pointed at the right thing?" — the two controls above pin the two
  specific measurements that were wrong, not the class. The general defence is the standing question
  at the point of measurement, which is an instruction and therefore fallible.
- **Note on this ID:** DC-009 was an unused number. The class was evidenced three times over in
  `docs/reviews/spike-dpi-and-ganged-resize.md` and `docs/design/phase-1-perf-results.md` — which
  explicitly name it as one recurring shape — but never written down here. It was assigned during
  the 2026-08-26 register repair, which is itself an instance of DC-001.
- **Status:** `partially-controlled`

### DC-010 — A system degrades under its own accumulated history and nothing notices
- **Signature:** a design that never deletes — append-only facts, an event log, an audit trail — meets
  its performance budget on a fresh store and drifts out of it as history accrues. Every individual
  write is correct and cheap; the cost is in the *quantity retained*, so no operation is ever the
  culprit and no error is ever raised.
- **Why it survives:** benchmarks run against fresh fixtures, which is the one state where the
  problem is absent by construction. It appears only after real use, arrives gradually, and presents
  as "the tool feels slow lately" — the shape of problem people stop reporting and start working
  around.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — P1-PERF measured refresh p95 at 192 ms on a fresh store, 567 ms after
  ten generations of the same scope and 785 ms after twenty, against a 500 ms budget. A morning's
  editing puts a workspace outside budget. The indexes and query plans were correct throughout; the
  cause was index maintenance over retained superseded generations.
- **Control:** `StoreCompactor` prunes superseded generations by **rebuild-and-swap**, never by
  deleting facts — the immutability triggers and the no-REPLACE rule are never suspended on the live
  store, so the invariant is not hollowed out to fix performance in one place. Detection is the part
  that closes the class: `WorkspaceCore.CheckCompactionNeeded` raises a `store.compaction_due` health
  incident naming the scope and its generation count, so a workspace that has quietly become slow
  **surfaces itself**. Measured 654.64 ms → 333.11 ms across a compaction, dropping 19 generations
  and 190,000 assertions for 97.6 MiB. Covered by `StoreCompactionTests`.
- **Residual risk:** the policy reports rather than auto-compacts, deliberately — compaction replaces
  the database file, so it belongs to a deliberate maintenance moment rather than a background timer
  that could fire mid-session. An operator who ignores the incident stays slow. Nothing is measured
  beyond 50,000 edges, so the ceiling has moved rather than gone.
- **Status:** `controlled`

### DC-011 — A refused operation says nothing, so refusal is indistinguishable from breakage
- **Signature:** a command is correctly declined — a locked layout, a minimum-size floor, a
  precondition unmet — and the system's response is *silence*. The control is working exactly as
  designed, and the user's only available reading is that it is broken.
- **Why it survives:** the refusal path is the branch tests assert least on, because the assertion is
  a negative: the operation did **not** happen, and "nothing happened" is trivially true of both the
  correct refusal and a dead keybinding. It is easy to miss for sighted mouse users, who still see
  the unchanged layout; it is total for a screen-reader user, for whom silence is the entire
  response.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — workbench layout operations refused against a locked layout and against
  the minimum-size floor returned an unchanged tree and emitted no announcement, so `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P`
  → *float* on a locked layout was indistinguishable from a broken command.
- **Control:** `LayoutResult` carries an `Announcement` on **every** outcome including refusal, and
  `WorkbenchAnnouncer` emits it through both the live region and the notification API; refusals
  announce their *reason* ("Layout is locked. Unlock to rearrange panes."), not merely their
  occurrence. Pinned by `WorkbenchCommandTests` and `WorkbenchControllerTests`.
- **Residual risk:** **not yet verified by a screen reader.** The automated tests prove the
  announcement is *produced*; NVDA Part D — the protocol step that would prove it is *heard* —
  remains un-run (`docs/reviews/nvda-workbench-session.md`), deferred by the owner as low priority.
  Until it runs, this class is controlled against the code and unverified against the product. A Part
  D failure means the control needs widening, not that the test was wrong.
- **Status:** `partially-controlled`

### DC-012 — A test runner reports success for a run that aborted
- **Signature:** the summary line says `Passed!` with a plausible number, and the run actually
  crashed partway. No failure is printed because nothing failed — execution simply stopped. Only
  comparing the *count* to a previous run reveals it.
- **Why it survives:** every signal a reviewer normally reads is green: exit status, the word
  "Passed", zero failures. The missing information is a **negative** — the tests that did not run —
  and negatives are invisible unless something asserts on them.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — `dotnet test` printed `Passed! - Failed: 0, Passed: 27` while the host
  had crashed and 21 tests never executed. Caught only because 48 had been observed earlier in the
  session; with no prior number it would have shipped.
- **Control:** `tools/verify-test-run.py`, run in CI in place of a bare `dotnet test`
  (`.github/workflows/build.yml`). Per project it requires: a result file exists at all (a host that
  dies early writes none), the run reports itself `Completed`, no failures/errors/aborts/timeouts,
  and **the executed count meets a committed baseline** (`tools/expected-test-counts.json`). The
  count check is the one that catches this class, because an aborted run's counters are *internally
  consistent* — they simply describe fewer tests than exist.
  **Observed failing 2026-08-26** by reproducing the original crash (re-enabling test
  parallelisation): bare `dotnet test` printed *"aborted"* and then
  *"Passed! - Failed: 0, Passed: 27"*; the gate reported `**SHORTFALL** 27/54` and exited 1.
- **Note on the same shape recurring during the fix:** verifying the gate's exit code through a
  shell pipe (`python … | tail; echo $?`) reported 0 because `$?` carries `tail`'s status, not the
  script's. Re-measured without the pipe: 1. A control is only as trustworthy as the measurement
  that says it works — which is this class's own lesson, arriving one level up.
- **Status:** `controlled`

### DC-013 — A monotonically allocated id is handed out twice because two trees allocate independently
- **Signature:** an id is assigned by reading the highest one present and adding one. Two working
  trees each hold the same highest entry, so both hand the same id to the next writer. Neither
  notices, because within either tree the allocation is correct.
- **Why it survives:** it is correct in a single checkout, and this repo's own worktree discipline
  guarantees there is rarely a single checkout. The collision does not surface at the moment it is
  created; it surfaces later as a merge conflict — or, when the file is append-only and merges
  cleanly, as two unrelated records sharing an id where one silently wins every lookup. The
  append-only case is the dangerous one, because nothing fails.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — `al-0012` allocated in two trees during the Phase-1b work; resolved by
  discarding one and re-logging. 2026-08-26 (**recurrence, same day**) — `al-0028` allocated to a
  logged prompt in the primary checkout and to the register-repair entry in a worktree; the merge
  refused. Both were caused by running a log-writing script in the primary checkout while the
  session's real work lived in a worktree, which is the WT-discipline violation underneath the class.
- **Control:** `tools/verify-audit-log.py`, run in CI: no id may be claimed by more than one entry in
  `audit-log.jsonl` or `change-log.jsonl`. **Observed failing 2026-08-26** against a synthetic log
  carrying a planted duplicate — reported the id, the count and the fix, exit 1 — and green against
  the real logs (29 and 8 entries, 0 duplicates).
- **Residual risk:** detection, not prevention. The gate names the collision *after* it exists, and
  the repair is still manual renumbering. Making it impossible means changing how ids are allocated
  — merge-time assignment, or ids that do not depend on knowing the highest — and that lives in the
  pack's `audit-log.py` rather than this repo, so it is an `/extendaibundle` candidate (CI8) rather
  than a local fix. Until then the second-order defence is the discipline itself: run log-writing
  scripts in the tree where the work is.
- **Status:** `partially-controlled`

### DC-014 — A capability cannot be tested because the test host lacks something the product has
- **Signature:** a feature works when the application is run normally and fails identically in every
  test environment. The failure looks like a product defect, so the instinct is to change product
  code — and any change "fixes" nothing, because the variable was never in the code.
- **Why it survives:** the test is honest, the assertion is right, and the red is real. Nothing
  distinguishes "the product is broken" from "the harness cannot host this". Worse, the pressure is
  to weaken the assertion until it passes, which converts a true red into a permanent blind spot.
- **Instances:** 2026-08-26 — ConPTY attaches a child process to a pseudo console only when the
  launching process owns a **real console**. A `dotnet test` host never does; its stdio is
  redirected. `Output_DeliversTheChildProcessesOwnOutput` therefore failed in every test run while
  the identical code captured 90 bytes of child output under `dotnet run` from a terminal. Several
  hours went into the interop before the console was suspected.
- **Control:** run the case **out of process** in a host that has the capability —
  `tests/AiDe.Core.TerminalHost` launched with `CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE`, driving the real
  `ConPtyTerminalSession` and reporting by exit code, with a report file so a failure says *why*
  rather than just returning a number. Verified capturing 297 characters of child output, and it
  passes in the very sandbox where the in-process form cannot.
- **The diagnostic that would have saved the time:** when a test fails identically everywhere, ask
  *what does the test host lack that a real run has* before changing any code under test. The
  distinguishing measurement here was three lines — `GetConsoleWindow()`, the std handle file types,
  and `GetConsoleProcessList` — and it should have been the first thing run, not the last.
- **Residual risk:** detection is still human judgement; nothing fails when a new test is written
  in-process for a capability the host lacks. The general defence is the diagnostic above.
- **Status:** `controlled`
